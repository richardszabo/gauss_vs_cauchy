Gauss vs Cauchy distribution plotting
=====================================
2015. 09. 11.
- First version: it was not easy to plot Gauss using graph.js from javascript physics book.
- Cauchy distribution added to the plot.

2015. 09. 18.
- Using second canvas to draw the plot.
- Plot creation from pixel to pixel. requestAnimationFrame is necessary to show the changes one by one. Using timing as well to avoid unresponsive browser.

2015. 09. 21.
- Using clearRect and complete redraw to clean up old data instead of ctx.globalCompositeOperation = "destination-out" what is not working for stroke (at least for me).

2015. 09. 24.
- Canvas fills the whole window.

2015. 09. 25.
- Canvas scaling dinamically changes as plot would overflow at the top.

2015. 10. 02.
- helper function became one module in helper.js.
