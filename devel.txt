Gauss vs Cauchy distribution plotting
=====================================
2015. 09. 11.
- First version: it was not easy to plot Gauss using graph.js from javascript physics book.
- Cauchy distribution added to the plot.

2015. 09. 18.
- Using second canvas to draw the plot.
- Plot creation from pixel to pixel. requestAnimationFrame is necessary to show the changes one by one. Using timing as well to avoid unresponsive browser.

- Using clearRect and complete redraw to clean up old data instead of ctx.globalCompositeOperation = "destination-out" what is not working for stroke (at least for me).

- Canvas fills the whole window.

2015. 09. 25.
- Canvas scaling dynamically changes as plot would overflow at the top.

2015. 10. 02.
- Helper function became one module in helper.js.
- Graph_example became one module in graph-example.js.
- Usage of require.js, it was quite complex to reorganize the code and it works after thousand attempts:
  - Filenames match declared modules names.
  - helper.js has been split to gauss and cauchy function files with define.
  - Graph is OK with new define.
  - Graph example functions need to be inside constructor definition.
  - New app.js requires Graph example as our main function.
  - Code cleanup: loop in app, prototype put back.

- Dynamic resize of canvas when screen size changes.
